		<h4>OUR HISTORY</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Baob’Art is a small marketing organization created in 2010 by Maura Mendes and Raphael Baptista mainly focused on promoting Mozambique’s craft across the borders. <br>

			<br>
			The two founders have known many of the craftsmen
			for years, watching them strugling to earn a living by their art. 

			For the producers of arts and crafts, market in Maputo(the capital) is the only direct marketing opportunity. The rest of the production goes on between dealers and buyers in the sub-Region (especially from South Africa). The proposed prices are generally low. With BaobArt the craftspeople have a chance again to export their products under the conditions of Fair Trade. <br>
			<br>

			Mainly focused on promoting Mozambique’s craft across the borders, BaobArt proposes a thorough quality control, the marketing of local products and support to the producers, especially in the areas of production, product design and development.
